    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>For this project, I chose the theme of a tailgate party before a big football game.  In this story, I included who attended and what they brought with them, as well as how much they ate and how much beer they consumed.</p>
<p>I chose some different arrays, variables, strings and numbers to explain the story throughout the timeline before the game started.</p>
<p>I did use quite a few functions as well as basic while and for loop statements.</p>
